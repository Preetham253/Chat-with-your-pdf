#Chat with Your PDF
Welcome to the "Chat with Your Data" project! This repository contains a series of Jupyter Notebooks demonstrating how to build a question-answering system that interacts with your data using the LangChain framework and the OpenAI API. The project is divided into six steps, each explained in individual notebooks.
Introduction
The "Chat with Your Data" project aims to create an intelligent question-answering bot that can interact with your data, retrieve relevant information, and provide contextually accurate answers. The project leverages the LangChain framework, OpenAI API, and advanced NLP techniques to achieve this.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

Python 3.8 or higher
Jupyter Notebook
OpenAI API Key
Usage
Each notebook in the notebooks directory corresponds to a step in the process of building the question-answering system. You can run the notebooks sequentially to understand and implement each step.
Notebooks
Step 1: Document Loading (step1_document_loading.ipynb)

Learn how to load documents into your environment.
Step 2: Document Splitting (step2_document_splitting.ipynb)

Split the documents into manageable chunks for processing.
Step 3: Vector Spaces and Embeddings (step3_vector_spaces_and_embeddings.ipynb)

Generate vector spaces and embeddings for the document chunks.
Step 4: Retrieval (step4_retrieval.ipynb)

Implement a retrieval system to find the most relevant document chunks based on a query.
Step 5: Question Answering Bot (step5_question_answering_bot.ipynb)

Build the core question-answering bot using the retrieved document chunks.
Step 6: Add Memory (step6_add_memory.ipynb)

Enhance the bot with memory to create a fully functional chatbot capable of maintaining context over conversations.
